# Med-Tracker

This will be an application that will let you keep track of your medication;
what time to take them, wether you have taken them, etc. On top of that it will 
offer an Alexa skill that will allow you to do all of the same things you could
through the application using only your voice.

# Technologies

The front end is written using ReactJS with [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) for the UI components. Back end is using Node.js and Express.

The live version is not much use yet since I haven't gotten the data server running off of my local machine yet.
